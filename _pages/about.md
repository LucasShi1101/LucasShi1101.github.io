Hi! I’m currently an MPhil student candidate at the University of Sydney 🏫, where my research focuses on Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models and Large Language Models (LLMs). I’m particularly interested in the internal mechanisms of modern AI systems, and my recent work investigates neuron-level representation, interpretability, and semantic structure within these models.

My broader goal is to better understand how generative models encode and manipulate information, and to contribute toward building AI systems that are more transparent, controllable, and reliable.

Thank you for visiting my website—feel free to reach out🤝!
